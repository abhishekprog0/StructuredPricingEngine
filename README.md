# StructuredPricingEngines
Contains code for the pricing engine of a Structured fixed income contract. Used GBM model for Stock process simulation and Vasicek, Hull White models for LIBOR rate simulation. We have assumed that we shall price the product at the current date i.e Dec-12-2020. Used 1 year historical stock data and LIBOR rate to calibrate the various parameters of the models used.
